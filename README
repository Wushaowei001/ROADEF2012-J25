Constraint-Based Very Large-Scale Neighborhood Search for Machine Reassignment

The Problem was posed by the ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2012.
See http://challenge.roadef.org/2012/en/ for the model and further details.

This is the final submission of Team J25 consisting of:
  Felix Brandt <brandt@fzi.de>
  Jochen Speck <speck@kit.edu>
  Markus Voelker <markus.voelker@kit.edu>

The presented approach is basically a very large-scale neighborhood search with
a constraint program (CP) to iteratively find improved solutions. In each
iteration a subset of processes (chosen by a neighborhood strategy) is "lifted",
i.e. considered for reassignment, while all other processes stay on their
current machine. Our constraint program then efficiently searches for promising
reassignments in the neighborhood. The overall search procedure alternates
between different neighborhood strategies until the time limit is reached.

As CP framework we use the open source toolkit Gecode in its 3.7.0 release.
